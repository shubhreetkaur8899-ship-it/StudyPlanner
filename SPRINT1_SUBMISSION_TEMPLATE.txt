TEST CREDENTIALS (For Instructor Review)
------------------
Email: instructor@test.com
Password: test123456

Note: This account has sample data including:
- 2 courses (PROG2500, DBAS2100)
- 4 assignments (2 pending, 2 completed)

API ENDPOINTS IMPLEMENTED
------------------

Authentication Endpoints:
✓ POST /api/auth/register - User registration with password hashing
✓ POST /api/auth/login - User login with JWT token generation

Course Management Endpoints:
✓ GET /api/courses - Retrieve all courses for logged-in user
✓ GET /api/courses/:id - Retrieve single course details
✓ POST /api/courses - Create new course
✓ PUT /api/courses/:id - Update course information
✓ DELETE /api/courses/:id - Delete course (cascades to assignments)

Assignment Management Endpoints:
✓ GET /api/assignments - Retrieve all assignments for logged-in user
✓ GET /api/courses/:id/assignments - Retrieve assignments for specific course
✓ GET /api/assignments/:id - Retrieve single assignment details
✓ POST /api/assignments - Create new assignment
✓ PUT /api/assignments/:id - Update assignment (including status)
✓ DELETE /api/assignments/:id - Delete assignment

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION
------------------

Database Schema:
✓ Users table with authentication fields
✓ Courses table with foreign key to Users
✓ Assignments table with foreign key to Courses
✓ Proper CASCADE DELETE relationships
✓ Status constraint for assignments (Pending/Completed)

Security Features:
✓ Password hashing using bcrypt (10 salt rounds)
✓ JWT authentication with expiration
✓ Protected routes using authentication middleware
✓ User-specific data access control
✓ SQL injection protection (parameterized queries)

Code Quality:
✓ Modular route structure (separate files for auth, courses, assignments)
✓ Centralized database configuration
✓ Consistent error handling
✓ Comprehensive input validation
✓ Descriptive variable and function names
✓ Comments on complex logic

TESTING PERFORMED
------------------

Local Testing:
✓ All endpoints tested using Thunder Client/Postman
✓ Authentication flow verified (register → login → protected routes)
✓ CRUD operations tested for courses and assignments
✓ Error handling tested (invalid inputs, missing tokens, etc.)
✓ Database cascading deletes verified

Production Testing:
✓ Deployed API accessible at public URL
✓ Database connection stable
✓ All endpoints functional in production environment
✓ JWT authentication working correctly
✓ CORS configured for frontend integration

KNOWN ISSUES / LIMITATIONS
------------------
1. Free tier Render services sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity
   - First request may take 30-60 seconds to wake up
   - This is expected behavior for free tier

2. No frontend interface yet
   - Will be implemented in Sprint 2 (React frontend)
   - Currently API-only, tested via Postman/Thunder Client

NEXT STEPS (Sprint 2)
------------------
- Develop React frontend with component-based architecture
- Implement user dashboard showing upcoming assignments
- Create forms for adding/editing courses and assignments
- Add filtering and sorting functionality
- Integrate frontend with deployed backend API

DEMO PREPARATION
------------------
I am prepared to demonstrate the following during the live review:

1. Show deployed API running at public URL
2. Explain database schema and relationships
3. Show route definitions in code
4. Demonstrate authentication flow
5. Perform CRUD operations using Postman
6. Answer technical questions about:
   - How JWT authentication is implemented
   - How PostgreSQL queries are parameterized
   - How middleware protects routes
   - How error handling works

RESOURCES CONSULTED
------------------
- Course workshop materials (Weeks 2-3)
- PostgreSQL documentation
- Express.js documentation
- JWT documentation
- Render deployment guides
- Node.js best practices

REFLECTION
------------------
This sprint focused on building a solid backend foundation. Key learnings included:
- Setting up and deploying PostgreSQL database
- Implementing secure authentication with JWT
- Designing RESTful API endpoints
- Using middleware for authentication
- Deploying to cloud platform (Render)

Challenges overcome:
- Understanding JWT authentication flow
- Configuring environment variables for production
- Managing database relationships with foreign keys
- Debugging deployment issues on Render

The backend is now fully functional and ready for frontend integration in Sprint 2.
